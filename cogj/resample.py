    Given a path along (n, d) points, resample them such that the
    distance traversed along the path is constant in between each of

    Note that this will likely clip the corners of the original path,
    and the original vertices are NOT guaranteed to be in the new
    resampled path.

    Only one of count at step can be specified. Specify count for
    uniformly distributed samples (e.g. np.linspace(0, 1, count)), or
    step for a specified step length (e.g. np.arange(0, 1, step))

        count, step - the number of points or a specified step length

            length so that an integer number of steps is used closest
